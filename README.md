# KeyFinder

## Architecture

## About Project
  ***Work in progress.*** This bot basically gets new coin listings from Binance using Binance API. An alert gets raised every time that a coin gets listed on Binance. After the alert, you can use the web page to purchase coins with the portion percentage. You need a Binance account to start trading. Then when you connect the API keys, you can purchase coins. Crypto trading is highly volatile. This project doesn't possess any trading advise. Trade carefully.
## Features

* You can contact with me to enabling other coins. Contact info below this page.
